# Instagram Post Reach Prediction
This sub-repository includes my work [code and CSV dataset (given and generated)] for the task of creating an ML model for prediction of Instagram post's reach (number of likes) based on certain parameters (number of followers and hours after posting) using pyhton library pandas (for structuring) and sklearn (for ML model creation).
