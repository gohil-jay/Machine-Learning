A: Numbers

# Task 2 - Data Collection and Cleaning
Q: What is the output variable in the dataset?

A: Likes

# Task 3 - Build your ML model
Q: Which function do you use to split your dataset in sklearn?

A: train_test_split

# Task 4 - Make Predictions
Q: What is the final MSE value that your model computed?

A: 108.64 (108.63581186362067) [solution in file - task.py]
