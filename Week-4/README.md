# Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

The aim for this week's task is to make an ML model based on Linear Regression to make predictions on the future price of any stock in the market (here, Apple [AAPL]), using Quandl for data collection and sklearn for model creation.

A: 12

# Task 2 - Data Manipulation & Feature Engineering
Q: Which symbol is used forfrom shift method in the current scenario (+ or -)?

A: -

# Task 3 - Build and train your ML model
Q: What is the name of the class in which linear regression classifier is present in sklearn?

A: LinearRegression

# Task 4 - Test your model
Q: What is the MSE of your model?
