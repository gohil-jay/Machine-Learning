# COVID-19 Analysis (Quantitative Modeling)
The task for week one is to perform exploratory analysis on provided COVID-19 dataset (CSV file) of India, containing details like date, number od cases (in 4 columns) and state of origin.

# Task 1 - Introduction to Quantitative Modelling
Q: Among additive and proportionate, which would you associate with the spread of COVID?

A: Proportionate

# Task 2 - Commonly used Mathematical Functions
Q: What mathematical function would we use to model the spread of a pandemic or epidemic?

A: Exponential

# Task 3 - Data Collection & Visualization
Q: What are the total number of cases on 04/03/2020?

# Task 4 - Model the Solution
Q: Use the computed r in the formula to make the forecase and find P_t. Take your P_o = 31 and t = 26 (the total number of cases on 4th March). Round off to the nearest integer value.

A: P_t = 324 [324.58] [r = 0.14814803793984233] (Solution in file - Task4.py)
