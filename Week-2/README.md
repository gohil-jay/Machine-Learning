# Flight Delay Prediction (Machine Learning)
The task for week two is to perform ML prediction on Kaggle dataset of flights' timeline (CSV file), in order to check whether the flight will be delayed or not, based on several factors provided in solution files above.

# Task 1 - Data Collection
Q: How many flights got diverted in the sample dataset?

A: 224 (solution in file - Task1.py)

# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Q: Which feature shows a perfect correlation wit 'ARRIVAL_DELAY'?

A: 'DEPARTURE_DELAY' (solution in file - Task2.py)

# Task 3 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
Q: How many flights got delayed by more than 15 minutes of 'ARRIVAL_TIME'?

A: 36221 (solution in file - Task3.py)

# Task 4 - Model Creation
Q: How will you fit the method if 'clf is the instance for the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm and 'x train' and y train' are training samples. Write the exact code statement.

A: clf.fir(x train,y_train) (solution in file - Task4.py)

# Task 5 - Model Prediction
Q: What is the ROC - AUC score of your model?

A: 99 [0.9981425213659479] (solution in file - Task5.py)

# Knowledge Evaluation
Q: What is the method to read CSV files in pandas?

A: read_csv()

Q: Which of these libraries are not used for visualization?

A: sklearn

Q: How are null values represented in pandas?

A: NaN

Q: Which method is used to split the data into training and test datasets?

A: train_test_split()

Q: What is the abbreviation for ROC?

A: Receiver Operating Characteristics
