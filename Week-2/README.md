# Flight Delay Prediction (Machine Learning)
The task for week two is to perform ML prediction on Kaggle dataset on flights timeline (CSV file), to check whether the flight will be delayed or not, based on several factors provided in solution below.

# Task 1 - Data Collection
Q: How many flights got diverted in the sample dataset?

A: 224 (solution in file - Task1.py)

# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
Q: Which feature shows a perfect correlation wit 'ARRIVAL_DELAY'?

A: 'DEPARTURE_DELAY' (solution in file - Task2.py)

# Task 3 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
Q: How many flights got delayed by more than 15 minutes of 'ARRIVAL_TIME'?

A: 36221 (solution in file - Task3.py)

# Task 4 - Model Creation
Q: How will you fit the method if 'clf is the instance for the DecisionTreeClassifier algorithm and 'x train' and y train' are training samples. Write the exact code statement.

A: clf.fir(x train,y_train) (solution in file - Task4.py)
